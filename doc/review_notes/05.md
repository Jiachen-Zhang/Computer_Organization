## Floating Point

### Rounding to Nearest Even

> - G (guard bit): the last bit of fraction bits
> - R (round bit): appears after G
> - S (sticky bit): appears after R or of all remaining additional bits

- RS = 00 -> Result is Exact, no need for rounding.
- RS = 01 -> **Truncate** result by discarding RS
- RS = 11 -> **Increment** result (add 1 to last fraction bit)
- RS = 10 -> Tie Case
  - Check Last fraction bit $f_1â€‹$
  - If $f_1$ is 0 then truncate result to keep fraction even
  - If $f_1$ is 1 then increment result to make fraction even

### Floating-Point Addition

Step 1: Make the exponents the same (increase the smaller)

Step 2: Addition of the significands

Step 3: Normalization

Step 4: Rounding

### Floating-Point Multiplication

Step 1: Addition of the exponents 

Step 2: Multiplication of the significands

Step 3: Normalization

Step 4: Round

Step 5: get the sign using `xor`
