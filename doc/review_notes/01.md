1. The five classic components:

   - Inputs
   - Outputs
   - Memory
   - Data path
   - Control

2. **ISA**: Instruction Set Architecture

   > Interface between the hardware and the low-level software.

## Performance

1. definition 

   > - **Response Time** (execution time): the time between the start and completion of a task.
   >
   >   > Including disk accesses, memory accesses,  I/O activities, operating system overhead, CPU execution time, and so on.
   >
   > - **Throughput** (吞吐量) : the total amount of work done in a given time. (also called Bandwidth (位宽))
   >
   > - **Clock Cycle**: the time for one clock period, usually of the processor clock, which runs at a constant rate.
   >
   > - **Clock Period**: The length of each clock cycle. 
   >
   > - **CPI** (Clock cycles per instruction): Average number of clock cycles per instruction for a program of program fragment.

2. formula

   - $Performance_X = \frac{1}{Execution\,time_X}$

   - Relative Performance: $\frac{Performance_X}{Performance_Y} = \frac{Execution\,time_Y}{Execution \,time_X} = n​$

     > X is n times faster as/than Y

   - $CPU execution\,time = CPU\,clock\,cycles \times Clock\,cycle\,time​$

   - $CPU execution\,time = \frac{CPU\,clock\,cycles }{Clock\,rate}$

   - $CPU\,clock\,cycles = Instruction\,count \times Average \, clock \, cycles \, per \, instruction$

   - $CPU\,time = Instruction\,count\times CPI\times Clock\, cycle\, time​$

   - $CPU\,time = \frac{Instruction\,count\times CPI}{Clock\, rate}$

3. Dependency

   - Instruction count depends on the architecture
   - CPI depends on
     - Memory system
     - processor structure
     - mix of instruction types
   - Performance of a program depends on
     - Algorithm 		=> 		Instruction count, CPI
     - Language                 =>                 Instruction count, CPI
     - Compiler                  =>                  Instruction count, CPI
     - Architecture (ISA)    =>                 Instruction count, CPI
     - Actual Hardware

4. Power Wall

   - $P = P_{static} + P_{dynamic}​$
   - $C = \frac{2\times P_{dynamic}}{V^2 \times frequency \, switched}​$
   - $P_{dynamic} = \frac{1}{2} \times Capacitive\, load \times Voltage^2\times frequency \, switched $
   - $percentage\, of\, the\, total\, dissipated\, power = \frac{P_{static}}{P_{static} + P_{dynamic}} ​$

5. Multiprocessors
